    "- **Order Rejections:** Sometimes a stock is \"short-restricted\" or has low liquidity. Your code needs to handle these errors without crashing.\n",

    "### Your Next Step\n",

    "**Would you like me to provide the specific code to fetch the last 20 days of prices from Alpaca so your Volatility calculation is perfectly synced with their live prices?**\n",

    "3. **The Error Catch:** Wrap your orders in `try...except` blocks. If Google's API is down, you don't want the whole script to crash before it manages your Amazon position.\n",

    "\n",
    "### How to Test This Today\n",

    "Since the market might be closed right now, you can run the `get_live_weights()` part of the script. It will show you exactly what your portfolio _should_ look like based on the last 20 days of action.\n",
